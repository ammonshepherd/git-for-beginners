      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Git can be scary. I get it. It took me years before I actually used Git. I
        worked as a systems administrator and ran web servers. We had many developers
        programming websites and applications; and they all used Git. I would pretend I
        knew how to use it, but I never had. I was scared I would mess things up, ruin
        the code, or delete everything and look like a fool. But this is exactly what
        Git was built to take care of. Fortunately, I forced myself to learn it through
        reading through lots of articles, books, documentation, support websites, and
        playing around with Git for personal projects. There are definitely ways to
        obliterate your work, but if you learn the why and the how, you can use Git
        safely. Just like driving a car. ;)</p>

      <h2>Why do you need Git?</h2>

      <p>Creating content can be messy. Naming files with dates, keeping track of
        different versions of files, keeping copies of everything “just in case”. This
        was especially true for me while I was in graduate school studying history. I
        had files with names that reflected who had reviewed the file, dates of major
        revisions, and files with names like “paper-final”, “paper-final-for-reals”,
        “paper-last-final”. My files were a mess.</p>

        <figcaption>Messy File System</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Now imagine writing a paper or coding a program in collaboration with other
        people. How in the world would you keep all those changes and files in a
        manageable workflow? That’s where a version control system, like Git, comes in
        very handy. But Git is really a content management system that happens to be
        really good at tracking versions. Most version control softwares before Git
        would keep track of the changes in each file. Git does it a bit differently.
        Git takes snapshots of your entire working directory whenever you want,
        effectively capturing all your work at any given point.</p>

      <h2>The Theory behind Git</h2>

      <p>This introduction to Git takes a different approach than most. Instead
        of just showing you a bunch of different commands to enter into your
        command line terminal, this tutorial shows you how you would do things
        without Git, by hand. This process makes the reason for the commands and
        the workflow very clear. Others have done this before, but their
        analogies dive too deep for the beginner. (See here for the inspiration
        for this tutorial and my personal path to Git enlightenment: <a
           href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/curious_journey.html">Curious
          Git</a>, and <a
           href="http://practical-neuroimaging.github.io/git_parable.html">Git
          Parable</a>) This introduction is meant for the beginner to Git. If
        you’ve never used Git before, this will help you understand how and why it
        works, and then give you the few commands you’ll need in your daily
        workflow. </p>

      <p>You’re going to build the functionality of Git by hand, as if you were writing
        a book. This has the benefit of showing how Git can work with non-software
        coding scenarios, and shows the steps and logic behind why Git works the way it
        does. You can easily imagine writing software instead, and I’ll throw in some
        coding examples here and there. This portion of the tutorial should be read
        only. You shouldn’t (or don’t need to) follow the steps here. They are just for
        illustration and explanation. You won’t really want to do it this way; you’ll
        want to just use Git. The second part of this tutorial will walk you through
        the steps to use Git in a simple daily workflow, either by yourself or working
        with others.</p>
