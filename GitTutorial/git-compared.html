      <h2>How Git Does It</h2>

      <p>Now that you have a better grasp of what goes into making a version
        control/content management system, we’ll take a look at the Git
        equivalents.</p>

      <h3>Snapshot folder = .git folder</h3>

      <p>Remember our snapshot folder? It was kind of distracting to see that
        folder in your working directory. When you turn a directory into a Git
        repository, Git creates a similar directory. Implementing a convention
        used by operating systems, the folder is named <code>.git</code>. The period
        preceding the folder name means that, by default, your file showing
        application (File Explorer on Windows or the Finder app in MacOS) hides
        that folder from view. (You can change this preference in the settings
        and thereby reveal a great many hidden files and folders on your
        computer.)</p>

      <h3>Staging folder = index file</h3>

      <p>Git does a lot more than what you learned in the previous pages. You had a
        folder for staging your commits. Git abstracts out a lot of this process and
        uses a series of files that point to the correct commit.</p>

      <h3>Snapshot = commit</h3>

      <p>In Git speak, a snapshot is called a commit; you're committing the
        snapshot to the snapshots folder, or as Git calls it, the repository. A
        repository acts as the history of your project’s files. It is a record of
        the changes, as recorded by you, every time you take a snapshot (or
        commit) of the working directory.</p>

      <h3>Timestamp folders = SHA1 hashes</h3>

      <p>If you peeked into the .git folder, you’ll notice there are no folders
        with dates for names representing your commits. Git stores all of the
        commits in a folder named objects. Within the objects folder you won’t
        find a bunch of files, either. Instead, Git creates a hash (a series of
        alphanumeric characters) of the contents of the file, and stores that as
        a file known as a blob.</p>

      <p>Git uses the SHA1 hashes to refer to the commits. To checkout, or
        view, a certain commit, you reference the SHA1 hash for that commit.</p>

      <p>There are a bunch of other files and folders in the .git folder, and a
        lot of functionality not discussed.</p>

      <h3>Alternative Timelines = branches</h3>

      <h3>Info.txt = commit message</h3>

      <p>A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to
        complete the following sentence:</p>

      <pre><code>
      If applied, this commit will <u>your subject line here</u>
      </code></pre>

      <p>Example subject lines:</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Add two pages to chapter 1</li>
        <li>Update notes with inclusion of step 4</li>
        <li>Add the fluffy bunny picture</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7 “rules” of Git commit messages</h4>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
        <li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
        <li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
        <li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
        <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
        <li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
        <li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>

      <h3>Merge lines = merge branches</h3>

      <h3>Reducing File Count = Git objects</h3>
